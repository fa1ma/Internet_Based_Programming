        <blockquote cite=""><i>In its native range in Africa, a yellow-tipped cultivar is associated with Oya,
            the female Orisha of storms. In Nigeria it is commonly linked with Ogun, the Orisha of war, and is
            used in rituals to remove the evil eye.[20] In Brazil its common name Espada de SÃ£o Jorge links it
            to Saint George, who by syncretism is also associated with Orisha Ogun.</i></blockquote>
