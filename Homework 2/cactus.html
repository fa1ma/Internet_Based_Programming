        <blockquote cite=""><i>Cacti inhabit diverse regions, from coastal plains to high mountain areas.
            With one exception, they are native to the Americas, where their range extends from Patagonia
            to British Columbia and Alberta in western Canada. A number of centers of diversity exist.
            For cacti adapted to drought, the three main centers are Mexico and the southwestern United States;
            the southwestern Andes, where they are found in Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina; and eastern
            Brazil, away from the Amazon Basin. </i></blockquote>
