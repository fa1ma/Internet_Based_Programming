        <blockquote cite=""><i>In South Africa, several species have been threatened with
            extinction due to poaching from the wild for the black market and mining related
            activities. The plants are mainly sold to collectors in Asian countries, where there
            has been a high demand for them.[27][21] It is illegal since 1974 to be in possession
            of protected succulents such as the Conophytum without authorisation in the Western
            Cape and Northern Cape, the two South African provinces where they grow.</i></blockquote>
